## Decadal results
### Verification of management wood volume targets and satisfaction

Wood demand for the historic period was prescribed by observed timber statistics in each province. Some scenarios (BAU, ASEA, RSB) aimed at 30% extraction rate throughout the century, whereas AMF targeted 40% and 70% extraction rates. No demand was defined for ACG or NOG. Actual demand values change from one decade to the other beacuse they depend on previous growth and could be affected by the climate scenario (i.e. somewhat lower demand in RCP8.5).  

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Nominal decadal wood volume demand per province and scenario.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/NominalDemandByDecade_provinces.png")
```

Actual wood demand included nominal wood demand as well as offset (i.e. the result of wood demand vs. actual cuts) from the previous year, but the information essentially is the same as the nominal demand:

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Actual decadal wood volume demand per province and scenario.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ExtractionTargetByDecade_provinces.png")
```

Extracted wood volume simulated by the model are shown in the figure below. They are of course zero for NOG, but note that extraction was almost always higher for ACG than AMF, meaning that a scenario not based on demand but on silviculture prescriptions may actually result in larger timber extraction. The extracted amount for scenarios BAU, ASEA and RSB was similar and lower than that of ACG or AMF.

```{r extraction, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal extracted wood volume per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ExtractionByDecade_provinces.png")
```

If we express wood extraction as a fraction of forest growth (i.e. extraction rates) we see that BAU, ASEA and RSB scenarios reach a bit less 30% of growth, except in Tarragona where they clearly fall below. Extraction rates of the AMF scenario are often above 50% of growth but do not reach 70% as projected, probably due to the fact that a large increase in timber extraction is not possible for some species (e.g. *P. sylvestris*) for the given silvicultural prescriptions. Extraction rates are highest in the ACG scenario, but they are always below 90-100%, so that even in this scenario one could expect wood accumulation.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal extraction rates per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ExtractionRateByDecade_provinces.png")
```

### Wood volume changes due to growth and mortality

Wood volume increase due to tree growth is highest for the NOG scenario, where tree densities are highest. BAU and ASEA are next, whereas wood accumulation rates are lowest in ACG and AMF, due to the highest extraction. Here the model may underestimate growth reduction due to competition effects. Growth varies also following climatic fluctuations and is somewhat lower under RCP 8.5.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal volume increase due to tree growth per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/GrowthByDecade_provinces.png")
```

Wood volume decrease due to mortality increases towards the end of the century, specially under scenario NOG. This is in part due to an increase of basal mortality due to higher living stocks. Climate change effects are also evident, specially under scenario RCP 8.5. The management scenario with lowest decrease due to mortality is ACG, which stay more ore less constant throught the century.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal volume decrease due to mortality per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/MortalityByDecade_provinces.png")
```

## Forest structure

Here we focus on simulated forest structure dynamics. Management intensities reported in the previous section are very important to correctly interpret the results.

### Basal area

In terms of basal area (an usual metric of forest development) dynamics there are substantial differences among management scenarios, but also some differences among climate scenarios. NOG is the scenario where basal area grows the most (here I would expect a slope decrease due to increase in competition, but see below), as could be expected, although growth rates are lower in Tarragona due to a more arid climate. Scenarios ASEA and BAU are almost undistinguishable and predict a substantially lower basal area accumulation. Scenarios AMF and, specially, ACG are those where basal area increases at the lowest rate, due to higher extraction rates. Climate change effects on growth rates are very small in scenario RCP4.5, but much more apparent in the 2070-2080 decade of RCP8.5.  

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of mean basal area, per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/BasalArea_provinces.png")
```


### Tree density

Like with basal area, temporal changes in tree density was strikingly different depending on the management scenario. As before, NOG is the scenario where density increased the most (note that historical period did include management), leveling off during the second part of the century. This is caused by an increase in basal mortality rates with the increase of basal area, counterbalanced by new recruitment. Scenarios ASEA, BAU and RSB resulted in rather stable tree density under RCP4.5, but including severe reductions in RCP8.5. The increased extraction rates of AMF and ACG result in a progressive reduction of tree density.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of mean tree (DBH > 7.5) density, per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/TreeDensity_provinces.png")
```

### Quadratic mean tree diameter

Quadratic mean diameter (i.e. average tree size) increased under all simulations, meaning that overall forests are expected to be formed by larger individuals. However, there are substantial differences among management scenarios in the rate of diameter increase, here being NOG the scenario with slowest mean diameter increase rates, due to a stronger effect of young recruits. In all the scenarios including management, prescriptions remove preferentially young individuals during thinning operations [below-systematic], causing an increase in mean diameter. RSB scenario also has lower mean diameter, but this can be an artifact of conversion from forests to agricultural/pastures. Generally speaking, the more intense the management, the higher the rate of increase of mean diameter. Very small differences among climate scenarios are observed.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of quadratic mean tree diameter per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/QMD_provinces.png")
```


### Coefficient of variation of tree diameter

The irregularity of stands, measured by the coefficient of variation of the diameter, varied strongly along the centudy and across management scenarios. Under many scenarios there is an increase in irregularity, being NOG the one with highest values. Only in ACG there is a reduction in diameter variability, specially in Tarragona. As with average diameter, differences across climate scenarios are minor.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of the coefficient of variation in diameter per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/cvDBH_provinces.png")
```

### Shrub cover

Shrub cover dynamics in the model is affected by tree canopy closure, management operations (although many species can resprout in the model) as well as its own dynamics. Generally speaking, shrub cover remained rather constant or slightly under RCP4.5, whereas stronger reductions were observed under RCP8.5 resulting from harder climate conditions. Differences across management scenarios were not large and occurred mostly in the second half of the century. Here the strongest reductions were observed under NOG, presumably due to tree densification, but also under ACG due to a more intense clearing during management operations. The initial decrease in shrub cover obtained for Tarragona may be due to an overestimation of shrub initial leaf area for this province, caused by the fact that allometric biomass models may not be representative for its drier conditions.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of the shrub cover per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ShrubCover_provinces.png")
```


## Leaf area index (LAI)

The dynamics of leaf area index (i.e. the one-side leaf area over ground area) is an important component to examine in simulations of process-based models, because it is a key functional variable for many processes (photosynthesis, transpiration, growth, etc.) and is also affected by anthropogenic (i.e. management) and natural (e.g. drought) disturbances. 

### Maximum stand leaf area index

Here we call maximum LAI to the leaf area value that the model predicts as function of forest structure. Thus, it excludes the effect of drought-induced defoliation which can temporarily reduce LAI. Here we obtained an overall rather constant stand LAI under RCP4.5, whereas strong LAI reductions occurred in the 2070-2080 under RCP8.5. In contrast with differences in forest structure, differences in LAI were not very large across scenarios, being NOG and ACG the more contrasted ones differing in 0.5-0.8 units by the end of the century, depending on the province. This can be explained by the fact that leaf biomass allometries take into account the degree of competition. Hence, when tree or shrub competition is reduced (e.g. due to a thinning operation) the remaining plants may increase their leaf area to profit from the increased light availability, so that variations in leaf area are buffered with respect to variation in forest structure (however, see below the compensation between tree and shrub LAI dynamics).

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of maximum stand LAI per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/TotalLAI_provinces.png")
```

### Actual stand leaf area index

If we focus on actual stand LAI values, now including drought-induced defoliation, we see that the overall patterns are similar, but with frequent drops caused by years with decreased precipitation. Here once can see the difference between those years where recovery is observed (i.e. plants where defoliated but did not died) as opposed to those years causing an effect in forest structure (i.e. drought induced mortality) and hence having long-term effects.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of actual stand LAI per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/LAImax_provinces.png")
```

### Tree leaf area index

The dynamics for overall stand LAI disaggregate into somewhat different patterns for trees and shrubs (here removing again the effects of temporal defoliation). Trees conform the largest contribution to stand LAI and are predicted to increase slowly (sometimes reaching an asymptote). Here, we see again climatic effects, and larger differences across management scenarios, of the order of 0.8-1.0 by the end of the century in Barcelona and Girona. Note the initial reduction of tree LAI under RSB, which is an artifact caused by the land-use conversion.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of maximum tree LAI per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/TreeLAI_provinces.png")
```

### Shrub leaf area index

Unlike tree LAI, shrub LAI is expected to progressively decrease under all climate and management scenarios, coherently with the predictions of shrub cover. Although the overall range of shrub LAI variation is modest (between 0.4 and 1.2), this decrease partially compensates the tree LAI increase, explaining why overall stand LAI was rather constant. 

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of maximum shrub LAI per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ShrubLAI_provinces.png")
```

## Wood volume and biomass stocks

### Wood volume stocks

Wood volume stocks generally increased under all scenarios, consistently with results obtained for stand basal area. Nevertheless, large differences can also be observed across management scenarios, resulting from the more or less intense wood extraction. Scenario ACG is the only one where wood volume stabilized (due to being not demand-based and adaptive to forest progression). Drought-caused decreases of wood stocks can also be observed under RCP8.5.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of (overall) wood volume stocks per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/VolumeStock_provinces.png")
```

If we differentiate between large wood for construction (or furnitures) from small wood destined to being burned (firewood), we see that the former repeats the same pattern.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of construction timber volume stocks per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/VolumeStructureStock_provinces.png")
```

In contrast, fire wood stocks have different dynamics, depending on the amount of trees of small diameter. Scenarios with stronger management effects reduce the stocks of firewood, as opposed to NOG which leads to an accumulation of firewood stocks. Climate change effects seem to be stronger for firewood.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Temporal variation of firewood volume stocks per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/VolumeFirewoodStock_provinces.png")
```
