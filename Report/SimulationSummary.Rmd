*Historical period*: 2001-2020
*Projected period*: 2021-2100

*Climate scenarios*:

 + **RCP 4.5**
 + **RCP 8.5**
 
*Management scenarios*:

 + **BAU**: Business as usual 
 + **AMF**: Alta mobilització de fusta
 + **RSB**: Reducció superfície de bosc

Simulations were run using packages 'medfate' [ver. 3.1.3] and 'medfateland' [ver. 2.0.2].

## Decadal results
### Verification of management scenarios

Wood demand for the historic period was prescribed by observed timber statistics in each province. Some scenarios (BAU, ASEA, RSB) aimed at 30% extraction rate throughout the century, whereas AMF targeted 40% and 70% extraction rates. No demand was defined for ACG or NOG. Actual demand values depended on previous growth and could be affected by the scenario.  

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Nominal decadal wood volume demand per province and scenario.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/NominalDemandByDecade_provinces.png")
```

Actual demand included nominal demand as well as offset from previous years, but essentially is the same as the previous plot:

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Actual decadal wood volume demand per province and scenario.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ExtractionTargetByDecade_provinces.png")
```

Extracted volumes are shown in the next figure. They are of course zero for NOG, but note that extraction was almost always higher for ACG than AMF, meaning that a scenario not based on demand but on silviculture prescriptions may actually result in larger timber extraction. The extracted amount for scenarios BAU, ASEA and RSB was similar and lower than that of ACG or AMF.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal extracted wood volume per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ExtractionByDecade_provinces.png")
```

If we express timber extraction as a proportion of growth (i.e. extraction rates) we see that BAU, ASEA and RSB scenarios reach a bit less 30% of extraction rates, except in Tarragona where they clearly fall below. Extraction rates of the AMF scenario do not reach 70% as projected, probably due to the fact that a large increase in timber extraction is not possible for some species (e.g. *P. sylvestris*) for the given silvicultural prescriptions. Extraction rates are highest in the ACG scenario, but they are always below 90-100%, so that even in this scenario one could expect wood accumulation.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal extraction rates per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/ExtractionRateByDecade_provinces.png")
```

### Wood volume changes due to growth and mortality

Wood volume increase due to tree growth is highest for the NOG scenario, where tree densities are highest. BAU and ASEA are next, whereas wood accumulation rates are lowest in ACG and AMF, due to the highest extraction. Here the model may underestimate growth reduction due to competition effects. Growth varies also following climatic fluctuations and is somewhat lower under RCP 8.5.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal volume increase due to tree growth per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/GrowthByDecade_provinces.png")
```

Wood volume decrease due to mortality increases towards the end of the century, specially under scenario NOG. This is in part due to an increase of basal mortality due to higher living stocks. Climate change effects are also evident, specially under scenario RCP 8.5. The management scenario with lowest decrease due to mortality is ACG, which stay more ore less constant throught the century.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Decadal volume decrease due to mortality per province and scenario", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Plots/MortalityByDecade_provinces.png")
```
